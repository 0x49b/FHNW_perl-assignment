# Title         : score_exams.pl
# Description   : Solution for part 1b), 2, 3
# Author        : Florian Thi√©vent
# Usage         : score_exams.pl <path to masterfile as txt> <list of filled out exams>
# How it works  : 1. load the masterfile from the first cli arg
#                 2. Extract all Questions and the right answers from masterfile
#                 3. Load an examfile
#                 4. load all answers to questions from the examfile, if no answer was given, it will be marked with a -
#                 5. compare the given answers to the correct answers from the masterfile
#                 6. make the stats and add them to stats array
#                 7. print out stats
#
#                 Finish.
